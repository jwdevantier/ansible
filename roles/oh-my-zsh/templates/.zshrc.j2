## WARNING!
## This file is auto-generated and WILL be subject to additional edits.
## Do *NOT* alter ANYTHING in here as it may be lost
## Instead, please make your changes in:
## * '{{ozsh__cfg_dist}}'
## * '{{ozsh__cfg_usr}}/<priority>-<your-cfg-file>.zsh'
##
## <priority> indicates when the file is run. E.g. '99-stuff.zsh' is run
## last and so its changes may override any made in the preceding files.
##
## NOTE - files in '{{ozsh__cfg_usr}}' will override settings in
##        '{{ozsh__cfg_dist}}' - use this to make personal changes.
##
## Do *NOT* change the following as it will break the ansible role:
## file id: <{{ozsh__rc_grep_key}}>

#Read in oh-my-zsh
source "{{ ozsh__rc_dist }}"

   The complexity is sadly necessary - zsh will complain lest we use
   nullglob suppression (which I can't figure out how works) OR redirect
   the error to /dev/null. The latter requires a separate line which then
   requires specifying how the cumulative output of the command should be
   broken up and treated as an array.
